# Magic the Gathering card database

A simple Next.js application that allows users to search for Magic the Gathering cards by name and view their details. The application uses the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) to fetch the card data.

Allows users to add cards to an inventory and specify ownership and condition.

Utilizes AWS Amplify to deploy the application and manage user authentication (Cognito).

Planned features include:
- User authentication
- Card sale through a marketplace (TCGPlayer, Card Kingdom, etc.)
